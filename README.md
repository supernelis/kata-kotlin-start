# Starter for a kotlin code kata

This repository is there to allow you starting a new code kata fast.

Requirements:
* Java (minimally 1.8)
* Gradle

## Clone and work on branch

One posibility is to clone the repo and work on a branch. 

```bash
git clone <url>
git checkout -b <name of branch>
```
I would suggest to name the branch something like ```2019_10_11_numberToWordKata```

## Download as zip

Another possibility is to download this project as a zipfile, extract it in a directory with the name of the kata.

Don't forget to init the git repository:

```bash
git init
```
